- The premise of the story of Llethis is that your characters are student mages, people developing their own type of magical combat. They've applyed to study under one of the most prestigious mages in the world, the #Witch of the #West, [[Lulunata Azureus]]. If they pass the admissions test, they'll be able to take lessons at the [[Azure Atelier]], widely recognized as the finest symposium of magic in the world.
- But it's not easy: to begin with, the registration fee is an eye-watering 500 Naleanian #lumens. And that's just to get a shot at the interview. After a grueling six hour one-on-one discussion and physical test with one of the proctors, your character has made it.
	- To accomplish this, they needed to have not only impressed, but even surprised the instructor. So give your character something special, either some kind of talent, or display of potential that is a cut above the ordinary.
	- Not only that, they can't be a complete newbie to the magic business. They need some experience for that potential to be visible, or a *really* good letter of recommendation.
- Finally, they've moved to #Lakali, in #Naleania, probably a few days before they commence their duties as apprentices. The year is 1374, and it's a gentle, temperate autumn.
