- One of the last [[living gods]], Viola is the #god of #Radiance. She has only a few current worshippers, hermits and other strange beings who still worship the [[Primordial Light]]. Though thanks to the machinations of the [[outer gods]] her divinity was sealed away, sealing away the true light forever is impossible. Though she currently maintains a careful balance with the majority of her godhead still fully sealed, even the remaining power she keeps in her "mortal" shell is sufficient to bring about the #Apocalypse.
- Although Viola likes to believe, or perhaps truly believes that she's merely a simple immortal girl going on an adventure, she is anything but. For now, however, she has managed to evade observation. That is, her existence, her presence, and her actions are currently not known to the wider world, not even to the other gods.
