- The #goddess of #magic, and one of the most present deities. Unlike #Shiyin, who hasn't been seen in centuries, or #Akasha, who has isolated itself beyond the world, Esyl maintains her throne upon the highest peak of the icy Alysha Mountains on the border of the Commonwealth and Duronia. Mages, scholars, and other pilgrims make the trip there each year on the month of the summer solstice, the only time her doors are open. Though none have met the goddess in person, it is said that those who make the journey experience magical enlightenment that could only be divine miracle.
