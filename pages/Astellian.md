alias:: astellians

- At the end of the middle ages, #Akasha took most of the #timekeepers away to the Library of #Records, but some remained in Llethis. Cut off from the god's divinity, they eventually became the Astellian people.
	- Astellians are characterized by their rounded ears, four, similar, well-proportioned limbs, and lack of tail. It's theorized that Akasha's influence was the most stable, and thus, Astellians resemble the human ancestors the most.
	- Because of this, Astellians are known for being resilient to disease, contagion, and miasma. Astellians tend to recover quickly from injury, and tend to have long lifespans with high fecundity. They are also well-known for physical strength and durability.
- Culturally, Astellians tend to center around patriarchal family structures. This is evident in their naming system, where sons of the family maintain the family's surname, while daughters marry into a different surname. They are otherwise quite diverse. Astellians are by-and-large spirit worshippers. The [[Astellian Spirits]] faith is the center of their spiritual culture.
- Astellians have little problems having children with members of the other races. Mixed-blood astellians generally share the same good health of their parents, and may have traits of both, only one, or some other combination of them.
- ## Culture
- ### The Nuclear Family
	- Astellians generally do not live with their extended family. This is actually a relatively new behavior. Farming communities and rural families do tend to live with their relatives, but in the cities, many families are what are called "nuclear families", with just the parents and children. They're often immigrants from smaller towns or rural areas.
	- Since Astellian parents tend to be fairly busy, children are often sent to daytime schools to be educated. This system is efficient and ensures relative equality.
- ### Otherness
	- Astellians are fairly diverse themselves. Though they tend to stereotype others, and are often very ignorant, one of their good traits is their ability to adapt to different situations. Rural Astellians tend to have very different views from educated city-folk.
	- One thing most Astellians are fairly wary of are demons. Though most have never even seen one, the idea of the evil demon still lurks in their cultural subconscious.
	- As for most other minority groups, well they tend to pursue an "out-of-sight, out-of-mind" policy.
- ### Taboos
	- Just because they have round ears doesn't mean their hearing is terrible. It's not *that* much worse. You don't need to shout. In fact, don't shout at anyone. Also, don't try to touch them. I know the round ears are cute, but keep your hands to yourself.
	- Respect their religious beliefs. As an outsider, don't comment on their habit of praying all the time. Astellian prayers are much shorter in general, so they have more, that's all.
