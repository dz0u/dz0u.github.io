alias:: lumen, currency, cash, coins, coin, money

- The lumen is the primary currency of #Naleania and #Jadralia. It is a single, circular coin with a hole punched close to the rim. This makes it easy to string together, and ensures that one side of the coin will hang below, also giving it a somewhat moon-like shape. Each coin is cut in such a way that it has little facets, and sparkles brilliantly.
- Lumens are made of a sort of natural crystal called Kealite. The coins are grown underwater, and then cut to specification. Kealite contains a small amount of magic energy, that made it valuable in the past for small enchantments. Magic has improved, and its practical value is less now, but it still works fine as a currency.
