- Similar to steam power in our world, but the use of coal and other fuels is significantly reduced. Magic power is currently cheaper and more accessible, but many mages and thus nobles (who tend to be mages) protest the development of steam power. They view it as demeaning and offensive, as the use of steam to convert magical power into universally applicable mechanical power is basically turning a mage into a human battery.
- For now, there are plenty of commoners with magic power and without such hang-ups, but the issue will inevitable come to a head as the technology improves, gaining greater efficiency, and the world changes.
