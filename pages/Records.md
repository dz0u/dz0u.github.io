alias:: record, time

- The divine rank of #Akasha. With the #deity 's disappearance, the divinity has been unable to maintain proper records of time. Nor is it able to record new events. In order to address this problem, the divinity has been self-cannibalizing, literally destroying the existence of the past in order for the future to happen. While not likely to cause something like the [[True Death of the Universe]], this is obviously inconvenient for just about everything that exists, has existed, or will exist.
