- Statuses are either negative or positive, sometimes both depending on the situation. They're capped at 6, and they're stronger than tags, but temporary. How long they last depends. For example, drinking a potion might give you the **powered-up-2** status for 3 turns. An unlimited number of statuses can apply to a move, while only 3 tags may be used. This makes statuses generally more important. That said, most of the time, your statuses will be stuff like **injured-1**. There are three primary kinds of statuses:
	- **Injury** statuses are basically your hitpoints. And they add up. Once you have a total of 5 in serious injuries, for example, **burn-3** and **cut-2**, your character gets the **immobilized** #tag and is now out of the fight. If you have 6 serious injuries... you die, with rare exceptions (for example, you and the dm may agree instead that **cut-6** involves your character being permanently crippled). There are also minor injury statuses. These will always be denoted by the word **minor**. For example, **minor-burn-2** indicates that you've received two largely nonthreatening burns. Minor injuries are not really life-threatening, and won't take you out of the fight. Instead, they'll make it harder to do certain tasks or make certain rolls. For example, **minor-bruised-leg-4** will subtract 4 from any move that tries to make use of that leg. Here are some examples of Injury statuses:
		- **minor-scrapes**: Your character is a bit bumped and bruised with little scratches. This might make it harder for them to do a delicate task, subtracting from the roll, or it might make it easier for them to earn a person's sympathy, adding to a roll. It'll go away with some time, or someone might take an action to treat your injuries.
		- **sick**: Your character has caught an illness. At lower levels it won't be very threatening, but as we all know, it could take their life if left untreated. This injury status might have a Character tag linked to it. A nearby character with a **doctor**  #tag might be able to help remove this, and similar injuries.
		- **broken-arm**: This status will make it harder to use that arm for anything. It's not a minor injury, so it'll be considered in the total count.
	- **Character** statuses affect your character, but aren't injuries. For example, **confused-2** might be a status. Or **fatigued-3**. Or on the positive side, **inspired-1**. All of these could be statuses. Character statuses will rarely reach anything higher than 4, and mostly come from your dm, or from an #action that creates them. Here are some examples of Character statuses:
		- **potion-sickness**: This character status might make it real hard to drink any more of those potions.
		- **excited**: Simple adrenaline and excitement might actually benefit you. Cheerfulness and confidence might add to communication, and it might make it easier for you to remain calm.
		- **dressed-up-and-slaying**: Might add a lot to your impression on important people! And your admirers, if you have any. Likely to go away if you change into something less drip.
	- **Item** statuses are just that: tied to an item. These are the longest-lasting statuses, and will generally remain as long as the Story tag they're linked to remain in the story. For example, a shield with **lasting-2** status tied to it, or a **flaming dagger** that is linked to the **burning-weapon-1** status. Here are some examples of Item statuses:
		- **lasting**: An important status that prevents the item from being removed as long as the status remains. Might also go under names like **strapped-on**, **reinforced**, or **magically-bound** depending on how exactly this status is applied.
		- **attuned**: A status that makes it impossible for anyone else to use the item's magical properties as long as the status remains.
		- **lacerating-weapon**: This status might allow the weapon to apply additional **cut** statuses when its used to attack. Alternatively, the effect might be **bleeding**.
