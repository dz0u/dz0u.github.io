alias:: plunderers

- A type of invader from one of the [[other worlds]] that tries to take energy from this one. These include #demons, #changelings, #harvesters, and #temporals. The danger of plunderers is that conceptual energy is finite. We can't make up for what they're stealing, and that means less life will reincarnate, natural cycles will slow, and eventually the world will deteriorate.
