- ## Backstory
  > Alia never knew the world before the frost. She has never seen the likes of the Last Autumn, nor will she ever. Snowblindness has rendered her eyes nearly useless, only able to perceive faint shades of darkness. Her parents were killed by bears, and as an orphan, she had no one to warn her of how dangerous the frost could be, even on the "warmest" days. Though they moved between multiple settlements in the past, during the 1915 whiteout, her group of nomads survived by offering their supplies in exchange for shelter with Beacon's hunters. They haven't left since, working alongside the natives.
- ## Powers
- ### Faction
  > The Pilgrims tend to cluster into tight-knit communities and enclaves. Alia calls the one she belongs to simply "the Family". The Family is but one of many similar groups. They're hunters and traders, but keep to themselves, dressing differently from the locals of Beacon and keeping different, older traditions. Ethnically, most of them descend from poor British Indian communities, primarily from the Iascars, brought to England as sailors aboard the East India Company's ships in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.
- ### Position
  > Her blindness, ordinarily, would have left her to be nothing more than a beggar, surviving on alms. But in the frostlands, where sight alone was no longer enough for survival, she still managed to live. Freezing temperatures meant that what little life remained tended to move beneath the snow or underwater, below thick layers of ice, and sight was useless for finding such prey. Not quite able to understand this, the Family has a superstition that she hears spirits, or devils, depending on who you ask, and they tell her secrets the seeing cannot know. She is a bit of a witch-doctor, and remedies that come from her are said to be more effective. This belief has drifted over to the local hunters, who will tell you to avoid the blind woman, lest you also end up cursed.

  > No
- ## Details
- ### Appearance
- > Alia has dark skin, dark hair, and pale, unseeing eyes. She dresses in colorful yet practical coats and robes that seem out of place compared to the local clothing, but to her people, is necessary for a young, unmarried woman (though she never expects to be married, given her disability). She usually wraps her long hair up under a thick red or saffron shawl and then a heavy felt hat over her head and ears, so only her face shows.
- ### Personality
- > Though outwardly polite and soft-spoken, Alia has a fiery personality when with people she's familiar with. She has strong opinions on everyone and everything, and even if she doesn't let you know, might let someone else know.
- ### Hobbies
- > Music is one of the hobbies remaining for her, and she is fond of both instruments and singing.
