	- <small> Lullaby for Tiu Lii - Hagali </small>
- Set in the late 14th century in Llethis, our protagonists are students of Lulunata Azureus's Atelier of magic. They are considered apprentices, that is, they're just beginning their magical journey. To have been accepted by literally the second-most prestigious atelier in the world, they would need to already have a little magical talent. For example, they might have received 4 or so years of schooling at an institution of magic, or been taught by a family member or tutor, or are simply a self-taught genius.
- There is also the testing fee, which isn't cheap. Tuition itself is free and living expenses are actually completely covered, but simply to get a chance to apply, you need to scrounge together 10 lumens.
- ## Prologue
	- Possibly the testing and application part of the story? Or just starting at the atelier
- ## Part 1
	- The atelier only has about 10 hours a week of direct teaching from a mentor, in small groups. The rest of the time, you're expected to do jobs. Your mentor will simply give you a list to choose from, and if you have special requests, you can bring it up to them. How you want to complete the task is actually completely up to you, and you're even given an appropriate budget.
	- The tasks the main group will have will primarily revolve around an ancient temple. Their explorations will first confirm that the temple is real, where it is, and then they'll begin exploring it, discovering anomalies in space-time that require more than just wits and talent.
	- Through their adventures, they'll learn that a strange, powerful enemy called the Faceless One is trying to make use of the temple to increase their own power. They'll discover that the temple concentrates divine power, which has been consolidated for millennia. An unknown evil god created it as the seat of their power Llethis.
	- To figure out what to do, they'll make the pilgrimage to the palace of Esyl, goddess of magic. But the Faceless One takes advantage of the situation to attack the palace from within. Their goal is to eliminate Kana, the witch of prophecy, and they nearly succeed. Lulunata is forced to stay at the palace to keep her alive, and the last remaining witch, Zhao Yu Xiao, orders the group to destroy the temple before it's too late, while using the forces under her disposal to hunt the Faceless One and their organization, thus distracting them. She gives them a single-use magic item to do so, containing the famous Red Ribbon Curse.
	- The group faces off against the Faceless One's disciples, and defeat them, destroying the temple and safely releasing the stored energy.
- ## Part 2
	- This was however, part of the Faceless One's plan. The Red Ribbon Curse is Zhao Yu Xiao's legendary magic, and it has surpassed the power of the gods. It is the finest wrecking ball mankind has ever made, and it punches through the barriers left behind by Akasha in a way the Faceless One never could. In truth, all she needed was for Zhao Yu Xiao to decide the temple was a threat so big it had to be destroyed, and she needed Kana out of the picture. How the actual destruction was delivered didn't matter, the group was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.
	- With the fall of the temple, a breach in the world barrier appears. From this breach, the elder gods are once again able to extend their fingers into the world. The Dreamer fully descends onto the Faceless One, giving her a face. The elemental god of fire descends onto the temple, and others in less grand fashion. They still can't act completely freely, as the barrier hasn't been completely destroyed, but pandora's box is open.
	- Kana is restored to health by Akasha, who also descends. They offer the group consolation, a warning, and also advice. Though the gods are mighty, they can't fully enter the world yet. If their envoys can be vanquished, the barrier can be repaired before they can descend again. Obviously, no ordinary human can go against the avatar of a god, but it would be possible if they could trace the steps of the angels and retrieve the lingering remnants of *Radiance*. Akasha gives them items to store this power, but also warns them of its danger.
	- Part 2 centers around going around finding pieces of Radiance, then going around and defeating the various gods. But no action is without consequences.
	- Finding the pieces of radiance isn't some innocent task. Using radiance to defeat the gods is like throwing nuclear bombs around. It's been slowly awakening the divinity within Viola. The Dreamer returns with their final, true plan: they want to seal Radiance itself, rather than seal the world away.
	- Its a plan millennia in the making. Finally, Radiance has descended into an avatar. They try to convince the group. Radiance itself is the inevitable cause of the end of the world. The reason the Middle Age ended, with all its glory, was because Radiance existed. If the group gave the Dreamer the pieces of divinity they carried with them, it could seal Radiance, forever. Then, the golden age would return. The Dreamer even tells them that Akasha agreed with the plan millennia ago, but *forgot*. In its weakened state, it overwrote the past, so their conversation simply never happened.
