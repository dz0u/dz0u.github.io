alias:: apocalypse, end times

- The theoretical final end to the world itself. There are a variety of possible contenders:
	- [[Loose Change Death]]: This theory states that when #plunderers from [[other worlds]] attack inhabitants of this one, their conceptual life force will be destroyed rather than returning to #Akasha.
	- [[Eternal Light]]: This theory postulates that should the #divinity of Radiance be once again fully manifested into the world, it will undo creation itself and return the world to the origin state. There is backing for this theory, it's exactly why the #gods sealed away Llethis behind the world barrier.
