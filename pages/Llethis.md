	- You can find most important pages under **Favorites** to the left.
	- Links can be followed simply by clicking on them, but hovering over a link will show a preview!
	- The goal of this central page is that you are able to understand the lore and mechanics of RP in the server simply by reading this page from top to bottom.
	- You can hide any block by hovering over its first line and clicking the little triangle that appears (shows up on the right on mobile, no need to hover). This might make it easier to navigate this page.
- # Lore
	- ## Teachings
		- ``Lore in this section is presented as the writings of prominent NPCs you might meet through RP. They are publicly available records that can be found in collections and libraries worldwide, and are translated into many languages. Note that although they are publicly available, most people would likely be unable to access them due to the difficulty of travel, lack of interest, and general lack of awareness. The more esoteric knowledge here is not common knowledge.``
		- ### *Journals of the Immortal Witch*
			- Magecraft is older than written history, making it difficult to pin down where it first emerged. What we know is that magic is connected to spoken words, regardless of what language is used. All mortal magic comes from the Dreamer, who bound her limitless power to the very concept of speech. For this reason, we mages offer thanks to this great and terrible Goddess.
			- Most people are capable of minor exertions of magic. However, those with the talent to become true mages are rare, and only about one in a hundred have an adequate amount of mental strength. This difference usually shows itself in early childhood.
			- For those with the talent to use magic, the first lesson must be the basics of how magic works. There are three steps to magic. Firstly, one visualizes the effect they wish to achieve. Secondly, the mage speaks the incantation they devised to activate it, maintaining their vision clearly in their mind. Finally, the spell is activated.
			- Complex magics are harder to visualize, and result in greater mental fatigue. Research has shown that when spells are cast, a vast amount of calculation is conducted by the brain to "fill in" the gaps in imagination. However, only the subconscious, language-faculty part of the brain is responsible for this. While repeated use will strengthen this part of the brain, the best way to improve your magic and relieve strain is to move some of that subconscious calculation into conscious thought.
			- This comes with better understanding of your magic. In other words, the clearer your visualization, the less work your brain needs to do to fill in the gaps, and the more magic you can use without becoming fatigued.
			- Human knowledge is, however, limited. For this reason, many mages pursue simple magics like the elemental powers, which are easy to understand and familiarize oneself with. Some mages have tinkered with modifying their body and brains to strengthen them, while others devise complex magic circles that undertake some of the computational burden automatically.
			- Though some of these strategies are successful, the limitations of time and lifespan mean that most mages can only pursue a few tracks of magic in a lifetime.

		- ### *A Historical Analysis of Thaumaturgy*
			- Thaumaturgy, or divine magic, refers to the various powers granted by one of the living divinities to their faithful. Its existence is objective fact. There are three divinities usually found among thaumaturges: priests of Shiyin, the cultists of Maka, and the fairy knights of Atenfowi.
			- Excluding Shiyin's priests, thaumaturges are super rare. You can always tell a thaumaturge because they don't need to speak an incantation for their magic. Thaumaturges usually have had a close encounter with the divinity they worship.
			- The power of a thaumaturge depends on the faith they have in their divinity. Using thaumaturgy requires you to clear your mind and give yourself to your deity wholeheartedly. Only then can they exert their power through you. In exchange, the mental burden of using divine magic is negated. For this reason, thaumaturges are often sought as powerful mages.
			- Thaumaturges practice rituals, prayer, and worship to deepen their devotion to their deity, making it easier to connect. However, most deities do not allow their disciples to worship or connect to any other deity. They are usually able to use regular magic, though they might find it less rewarding.
			- Shiyin's priests have a slightly different experience. Almost anyone who worships the benevolent goddess may borrow her powers. The only requirement is true faith. The deeper the faith, the more good actions, and the further the priest spreads the faith, the more powerful their thaumaturgy.

		- ### *A Mechanic's Toolbook, 2nd Edition*
			- You currently hold in your hands the second edition of *A Mechanic's Toolbook*. When I read the first edition, I was but a young lad working on Mr. J. Earp's copper mine. Mr. Earp had ordered a brand new engine from Mr. S. Ramathusan, so as to draw water out of an old, flooded tunnel. The foreman couldn't understand head or tails of it, so he gathered those of us that could read, and we went over the whole toolbook page by page, as if it were a holy grail.
			- Now I am Director of the International Board of Steam Mechanics, and it is my honor to write the preface to this guide for a new generation of mechanics. The machines you will be working on are no longer the simple pumps and engines of my youth. If you're reading this in Alaris or Naleania, you have most likely heard of the new Transcontinental Railway, which may be open by the time you read this. Airships powered by new magical engines now float in the skies, and steam power is replacing sails in the waters.
			- Every part of our world is changing thanks to this revolutionary new technology. It's possible that wars will be a thing of the past, and soldiers will hang up their guns after visiting the lands of their former enemies, thanks to the new rails! And you will be a part of that transformation!

		- ### *Atlas of the World, 1374*
			- ![Llethis 2025-10-21-13-33.png](../assets/Llethis_2025-10-21-13-33_1761078857376_0.png)
			- There are six great nations ruling the inhabitable lands of the world. A traveler would do wise to understand that the laws in any one country are largely decided by provincial ordinances, and to be cautious at all times.
			- Nonetheless, we will attempt to provide an excellent summary for the new traveler of the various nations peculiarities, so that they may experience a safe and enjoyable journey.
				- The Principality of Alaris is the home of the Astellian people, who you may know for their peculiar round ears (much like a Lu's) and lack of physical adornment. They are a strict people. Denathan travelers in particular, be observant! There is a saying: when in Movil, do as the Movilans do. Alaris's laws are harsh, due to its archaic, feudal system, however, its people are hospitable and polite. It is a very old country, and you may find interesting the relics and historical sites of the country, as well as the fabulous art galleries and operas. The primary language spoken is Astellian, but some there also speak Denathan.
				- The Naleanian Commonwealth, spread around the Inner Sea, is where most Denathan folk live. A Denathan may be recognized for his or her animal traits and body parts. Denathan that look similar may belong to the same clan or tribe. Denathan homes are warm and comfortable. They are excellent sailors, thanks to the peaceful waters of the Inner Sea, and fish and fare are widely available. Most Denathans speak Astellian, and Denathan-speakers are now a minority. Travel is thus fairly convenient.
				- We warn any travelers heading to the Council of Cania's territory to be extremely alert. The recent civil war and war with Alaris mean that the country is dangerous to travel to as of this time, outside of the southern cities. Otherwise, it is a nation similar to Alaris.
				- Visitors to the Jadralian Marshes are cautioned to be careful not to offend the locals' worship of the god they call Maka. They take blasphemy very seriously, and some visitors have been burned for the crime. It is a beautiful nation otherwise, and has lush cloud forests. The people speak a strange mixture of Astellian and Denathan, but it is not hard to understand after some time.
				- The Kingdom of Duronia is home to the elusive Eos Sithe. This northern nation is home to many legends and fairytales. We highly recommend visiting Chear! The beautiful people and welcoming stores and casinos will make you feel immediately welcome in the city they call 'Paradise'. The sidhe language is spoken exclusively in most other cities of Duronia, so we encourage tourists not to wander too far.
				- The Hua Divine Empire, to the far East, is a mysterious and vast country ruled by a powerful Emperor. They worship the deity Shiyin as well as a variety of household gods. The goddess's church is very powerful there, and it is recommended to be cautious when discussing theology. Otherwise, they are fairly welcoming to outsiders. However, you are unlikely to find anyone who speaks a Western language, so we recommend learning some basic Lu.

	- ## The Azure Atelier
		- ```Lore in this section discusses the Azure Atelier. This information is a mixture of common knowledge and information your character would learn shortly after joining the Atelier. Your characters are students of Quinta, in Class 3.```
			- ### Personnel of the Atelier
				- Established by Lulunata Azureus, the Immortal Witch, in IY1346, the Azure Atelier is the premier institute of magical study in the West, despite its young age. The renown and capability of the institution's educators cannot be understated.
					- Headmistress: Lulunata Azureus
						- The famed Immortal Witch, Ms. Azureus is an extremely talented alchemist and mage who has contributed to magical society for nearly four hundred years. This is the first time she has ever created an organization dedicated to educating new talents.
					- Instructor: Ranu Bakir
						- Known as the Thunderer, Mr. Bakir is the inventor of mass teleportation and widely recognized as one of the mages who has transformed the field of magic. He was the instructor for the second class to graduate from the Atelier, and is the current instructor for Class 1 (Sirius Suhayel).
					- Instructor: Aster Belliad
						- A former student under Ms. Azureus, Mr. Belliad has returned as an instructor for Class 2 (Haullen Bywood, Isa Namuid) at the Atelier.
					- Instructor: Quinta
						- A well-respected Librarian, Quinta is instructor for Class 3 at the Atelier, the largest class the institution has ever seen. She is known for her work in documenting the history of magic.
			- ### Location of the Atelier
				- The Atelier is located in the town of Lakali, in northern Naleania. The school itself is a former lighthouse, on a large piece of private land. The central building consists of one lecture hall, a kitchen, two bedrooms, an infirmary, three storage rooms, and an underground laboratory. Students are expected to find lodging in town, the funds for which are provided. Students are encouraged to room together to build teamwork and prepare them for the long missions Atelier students go on.
			- ### Style of Teaching
				- The Atelier's instructors believe that the best way to learn is to experience for oneself. Students at the Atelier will grow and develop their magical and interpersonal abilities through expeditions and missions throughout Llethis, gaining hands-on experience under the supervision of their instructor.
	- ## Mythology
		- `Lore in this section pertains to the origin of the world and the histories of the deities. It is divided into two parts. The first part, Cosmogenesis, discusses the way the universe came into being. The second part, Theology, discusses the histories of the deities. You can consider this to be a grand, cosmic timeline of events. As such, most of the information discussed here is completely unknown. Only certain aspects of Theology are known, primarily to the worshippers of such gods, and passed down in myths and legends. Particularly noteworthy myths will be linked to their own pages.`
			- ### Cosmogenesis
				- The primary theme of Llethis's mythology is that *existence precedes essence.* This means two things: firstly, there is no such thing as fixed meaning, purpose, or destiny. Secondly, whenever something comes to exist, a spirit embodying it will as well.
					- This property is referred to as *spirituality*. To understand spirituality, we first need to understand *causality.* When two items or concepts interact, their result goes on to affect other things, this is the basic law of cause and effect. The more things something affects, the greater its *causality.* For example, the causality of a simple stone is limited. An ancient tree on the other hand, might have a (relatively) vast amount of causality, affecting the ground it grows on, the animals sheltering and depending on it, the plants around it, and perhaps the people living around it. Cosmic forces like time, space, light, have almost limitless causality. The more causality a concept bears, the more spirituality it develops, and the faster it develops its spirituality and consciousness.
					- Particularly powerful spirits are referred to as deities. There is no distinctive barrier between the two. More accurately, the gods of Llethis are simply spirits so powerful that humans have chosen to worship them. The spiritual power of a deity is referred to, generally, as *divinity.*
					- Furthermore, because of the nature of spirituality and causality, older spirits are generally more powerful and intelligent. The oldest spirits, the so-called Elder Gods, possess near limitless spirituality.
				- What then, was the first thing to exist? The answer is the universe itself. Similarly to our own universe, the world of Llethis began with the Big Bang. Prior to that, for an unknowable eternity, the entire universe was an infinitesimal point of infinite light and radiance. Then, this light expanded, forming the universe as we know it.
				- It is at this moment, only a few fractions of a second after the birth of the universe, that the first spirit formed. The spirit of Radiance, but understanding its origin, you could also call it the spirit of Everything. It would later name itself [[Viola Corvus]], but as for now, it was merely "Radiance".
				- With spirituality comes sapience. Thus, the universe of Llethis was crafted by intelligent hands. Radiance separated from itself a darkness, within which the universe could truly grow: after all, too much light is as harmful as too little.
				- Darkness, then, was the second thing to exist. It too, soon acquired spirituality, becoming the spirit that would later be called the [[Dreamer]]. It and the bright light shared the universe, and where they mixed, matter was crafted.
				- That matter would become the world of Llethis itself. While you could describe Llethis as flat, it is not truly so. The world does not exist in 3-dimensional space, and is merely a representation of the infinity of darkness and light it was created from, compressed into a vaguely disk-shaped form. Travelling forever in any direction will eventually take you straight into the starry sky, after an infinity.
				- At first, there were no stars, no moons, and no suns in the sky. The cold, frozen world harbored deep and empty oceans. The spirit of the world developed into [[Kehoa]], the third elder god. It was a desolate, empty world.
				- Then Radiance extended its arms, and put the stars and nebulae in the sky. It reached down and put two suns over Llethis, shining each day. They melted the ice and warmed the seas. Note that they never developed spirituality, because they were still part of Radiance. Hence, there are no sun or star gods in Llethis.
				- With sunlight, so came life. Living things first flourished beneath the water, then evolved to colonize the land. The fourth and final elder god was Seth, goddess of Life and Withering.
				- This is the true history of the origin of the universe. Various religions have their own interpretation, but most have similar elements: a distant past of endless light, followed by the birth of everything.
				- The Mythological Era ended with the War in Heaven. A generation of younger gods was born in later times, ruling over the world until this day. The specific details of how this occurred are not known to anyone, and are a story secret.
			- ### Theology
				- The Elder Gods ruled the universe in its infancy. There are only 4 such deities.
					- [[Viola Corvus]], goddess of [[Radiance]]. The Creator God of Llethic mythos. She represents the entire universe, the state of All-ness, and infinity. Following the War in Heaven, she disappeared, only to be reborn into the world in 1372. It was at this time that she took the name "Viola Corvus", believing herself to be an ordinary cleric. The true scale of her divinity is yet unknown to her. Worshipped by the Lightbearers, a rare sect that prefers personal devotion over structured religion.
					- The [[Dreamer]], goddess of dreams and darkness. The counterpart who helped create the world as it is. She represents absence, void, shadows, and imagination. Following the War in Heaven, she was exiled to the shadows beyond the world. From there, she extends distant thoughts into mortal dreams, endlessly striving to manipulate and control. Worshipped by rare evil demons and chaotic beings, and widely recognized as an evil god.
					- [[Kehoa]], god of water, the seas, and the physical world. It did not take part in the War in Heaven, and was not even seen during it. He continues to reside at the deepest depths of the seas, silent yet unimaginably vast. His surfacing would herald the apocalypse. Worshipped by the Denathan people as the ultimate Devourer in their totemic faith.
					- [[Seth]], former goddess of Life and Withering. Primarily responsible for the War in Heaven. Her divinity was shattered and sealed away. She can never be allowed to be truly slain, lest all life perish. Does not have a living sect.
				- The [[Pantheon]] represents the younger gods who were born after the War in Heaven. Most of these deities are still actively worshipped. However, in the last three centuries, they have generally secluded themselves from the world.
					- [[Akasha]], god of [[Records]], is the foremost of the younger deities. God of time, it was birthed after the [[yith]] invented language. Its true form is an infinite library, containing records of all time since its birth to the present. However, Akasha vanished three hundred years ago, meaning that there is no more space for further records. To allow time to still function, the Head Librarian has ordered that books describing the past will be overwritten to make space for the present, leading to wide consequences. The Akashic Library is still maintained by the devoted Librarians, masters of Akashic magic.
					- [[Shiyin]], god of [[salvation]], is the chief deity of the [[Hua Divine Empire]]. Unique among all deities, she offers her divine magic to anybody who sincerely believes in her. This is verifiable fact, and has resulted in the wide spread of the [[Church of Mercy]].
					- The [[Ruisi]], four gods worshipped by much of the Divine Empire as a folk religion. They represent good fortune and various elemental forces. While they command a vast following, as a folk religion, their worshippers lack organization. Rather than true worship, it is more as if they are given respect but not devotion.
					- [[Maka]] is the mysterious god worshipped by the Brigionese Sect of the Jadralian Marches. It is a deity representing truth, ultimate truth, and is popular among mystics and their like.
					- [[Atenfowi]] is the chief deity of the Eos Sithe people. Known as the Father, or the Watchmaker, the Eos Sithe believe that he lives among them and guides them, but that they must not speak of his presence in such a way. They are almost fanatically respectful of him, despite their usual fiercely independent nature.
					- [[Senalestel]], the phoenix god, is the primary deity of the Astellian people. They represent resurrection and reinvention. While chief among the spirits they worship, the Astellians generally pray to their ancestors, and acknowledge Senalestel as their guiding spirit. A benevolent deity, they are known for selecting the weak and downtrodden as their chosen paladins. Thus, to many, Senalestel represents hope. It is no coincidence that the Astellian faith is the most widespread in Llethis, with seventeen million devotees.
