alias:: denathans, beastfolk, beastkin

- The denathan people descend from a variety of races transformed by the power of #Seth. She created their ancestors, the half-humans, as her persona of #Life, in order to defeat the forces of #Death. They were made for battle, and their ancestors had the power to transform completely from their humanoid forms into beasts of war.
- The descendants of these heroic warriors are now firmly fixed to their current appearance, but still sport beastly traits, depending on whatever animal or monster the goddess chose to mix with humanoid traits.
- Culturally, the denathans tend to be matriarchal, though this is not always the case. Sons are usually expected to leave the family unit to marry into a different family upon adulthood, while daughters remain, learning from their mothers. However, the denathan are extremely diverse, and though this behavior is common, other tribes may not follow the same traditions.
- Though the denathan people are generally very robust and physically fit, their bodies tend to wear down faster than their [[astellian]] neighbors, and they age somewhat quicker, with shorter life expectancies.
- Denathan are not actually very common. Of the four modern races, they have the lowest population. However, due to their diversity, they have an advantage in exploration and conquest. Almost the entire Denathan population lives in the [[Naleanian Commonwealth]], which has earned a fortune through conquest and trade.
- ## Culture
- ### Tribes
	- The Denathan peoples are probably the most diverse of the modern races, having been molded by Life herself. They tend to divide themselves into tribes based on their features and ancestry, and each tribe has its own traditions.
	- In general, however, most Denathan tribes are matrilineal, and children are raised primarily by their mothers. Education is not a major concern for many families, but the Denathan have picked up on the Astellian schooling system, and do implement it.
	- Tribal pride is fairly important for many Denathan, who identify stronger with their tribe than with the people as a whole, or their nation.
- ### Otherness
	- The Denathan people are relatively accepting of others. They themselves are extremely diverse, so when a demon shows up, it's not a serious shock. "Just another weirdo from that tribe across the river" is what a Denathan might think. The same is true for the other races.
	- Likewise, the Denathan are fairly accepting of LGBTQ+ individuals. Different tribes have different habits. Some even practice polygamy, though this is generally frowned upon.
	- Some Denathan do not identify with any specific tribe, and this too, is accepted. These loners tend to actually be fairly popular, as they are often travelers with interesting stories to tell and coin to spend.
- ### Taboos
	- One thing that Denathans value is strength. A common way to settle conflicts throughout their peoples is with a duel, which can end up lethal. Some cities have tried cracking down on the habit to no avail. It's generally considered incredibly shameful to not show up when challenged, serious enough that people are often forced to flee the area.
