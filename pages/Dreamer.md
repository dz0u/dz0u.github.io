- The greatest #deity of #Disorder, and the true creator of magic. The intentions and purposes of the Dreamer are little-understood, even by her fellow [[outer gods]]. Her rank of [[dreams]] seems hardly sufficient to merit her overwhelming divine power, power so great that only #Akasha or #Seth could contest it during her time.
- However, at the end of the great war of the gods, Akasha was able to successfully seal her away. But she is also the slipperiest of the gods, and as long as there are those who dream, she can find them.
- The Dreamer is one of the few true evil gods. During the Middle Era, she corrupted countless peoples, bringing them to her by offering them their deepest wishes. In exchange, she took their bodies and minds, enslaving them to her will. These became the elder #demons.
