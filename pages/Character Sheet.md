- ### Backstory & Personality
	- Backstories don't need to be super detailed. They're really for you, not for me. A good backstory will help you play your character, which is why I've combined it with personality.
- ### Equipment
	- Here's where you'll put your equipment story tags. Some special equipment might have a #status associated with it, but those with positive statuses are relatively rare or complex. Examples:
		- **Astellian-Shortsword**: Acquired from a blacksmith in Alaris
		- **Alchemical-Cauldron**: Inherited from aunt. When carried, invokes **overencumbered-1**.
- ## Submission Guidelines
- *Character-Tags* includes your character's **race**. The playable races are #Astellian, #Denathan, #Lu, [[Eos Sithe]], and #Demonkind. Your character's race may change during the story's progression.
	- Generally you want to have at least 3 additional character tags.
		- For example, your character's chosen profession. **Mage** is one such possible choice.
		- You might also include things your character is knowledgeable and experienced in. If they have a green thumb and do a lot of gardening, maybe add that as a tag too. Or if they're experienced in combat, you could add a **veteran** tag.
		- There's no upper limit, and I'll work with you to make sure your tags fit your character and the setting. Some examples of things that will generally require a tag might include:
			- Very young or elderly age/appearance might necessitate a **child** or **elder** tag. Characters with unusual appearances might need a **stands-out** tag.
			- Equipment doesn't go under **character-tags**. Instead, you'll want to put that in its own specialized section.
		- One thing people might not think of is personality-related character tags. If your character is particularly quiet, you might want to add a **nonverbal** tag.
- *Ability-Tags* on the other hand are basically things your character can do. Examples might include **denathan-swordsmanship** or **ice-magic**. Keep in mind that our current premise is that your character is still quite inexperienced with combat. Ability tags might also include non-combat skills, like **forging** or **alchemy**.
