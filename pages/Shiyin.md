- The supreme #goddess Shiyin of #Salvation is the most-honored goddess in Llethis, though not the part of the most-worshipped faith. One of the members of #Pantheon, Shiyin last made her presence known over three hundred years ago when she manifested a miracle of healing that saved an #Emperor. She has never been witnessed since.
