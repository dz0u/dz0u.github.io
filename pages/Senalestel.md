- The earliest records of Senalestel in the Library of #Akasha show that it came into existence during the Prehistoric Era. As a phoenix- #god, it's quite likely that it was not first worshipped by humans. Certainly, it had no significant sect or following during the Middle Era. It is hypothesized that after #Seth vanished, her faithful turned towards a different protector, Senalestel. Their #divinities are certainly similar. Senalestel is the deity of [[Rebirth]], and one of the true [[Elder Gods]]. However, in the thirteen centuries since the end of the Middle Era, none have seen the true form of the god. Yet faith in it is so widespread that its figures are everywhere in the #West.
