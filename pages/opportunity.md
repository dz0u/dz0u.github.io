alias:: opportunities

- When the character before you rolls a tie, you get the chance to take an opportunity. You're **guaranteed** success on your roll! You still choose tags to use, but you don't need to actually roll *provided* that you're trying to help or harm the previous character's action.
- For example, if the previous character was trying to kick down a door, you might use your opportunity to bust the hinges with your axe. Or if the previous character was fighting an enemy, you might use your opportunity to hit them from the side.
	- Alternatively, you could use your opportunity to trip the enemy, and make them fail. Both are possible, as long as it's related to the previous character's #action. Action rules still apply to what  you're trying to do.
