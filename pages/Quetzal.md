- ### Personality
	- Independent and headstrong, Kirara was largely raised by her grandparents due to her father's frequent absence. She doesn't resent him for it, understanding the pressure he faces as a single parent and immigrant in the business world of Hollywood.
	- Kirara generally struggles with issues of her own identity. Sometimes, she feels as American as apple pie, hanging out with her classmates (many of whom have their own unique identities) and immersed in their shared culture both in-person and online. But at home, she speaks in Japanese, eats traditional Japanese food, watches Japanese shows with her grandparents, practices her kanji and katakana, not knowing when she'll ever need to use them.
	- There is also the part of her that's... different. From everybody else on the planet. Her father always told her that her mom came down from the moon. Which she learned was supposed to be nonsense, except that her grandparents said so too, when they did speak of her mother. And there's no denying the natural blue of her hair, or the fact that she can crush steel in her fingers like putty. It was definitely weird when she started flying, last year. But apparently it's just how her mom got around.
	- Then again, she's not the only one with APH. However, it's meant to be a secret with her, and at least her dad's lawyer has made the school keep it a secret, under some privacy law. She's always keeping her cool, making sure she doesn't use too much strength, and observing how "normal" people work. She's good at it.
	- But sometimes a girl needs to do the right thing. Her grandfather, a survivor of the Great Hanshin Earthquake of 1995, told her stories of human unity and love in hardship that stuck with her forever. Kirara always keeps a mask and a plain black hoodie in her backpack just in case she ever needs to kick ass... while not making her dad worry by ending up on TV.

- ### Abilities
	- **Superstrength**: Kirara is incredibly physically strong, especially considering her size.
	- **Super Durability**: The above would not be possible without crushing her organs and bones without her incredible durability and resistance to almost everything. She can even survive the extremes of outer space (her mom is from the moon after all, so if anything it's her natural environment).
	- **Flight**: Kirara flies completely freely, defying gravity as if it weren't there at all. Her top speed is actually faster than she can consciously keep up with, so she has to make sure she doesn't go so fast she loses control. Kirara is *very* careful about flying in urban areas even when disguised, because one wrong move and she cannonballs through a 3 million dollar office building.
	- **Shovel**: $14.95 from Home Depot
