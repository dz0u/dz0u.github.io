- The generally-recognized four gods of the Lu folk religion. Each #Deity represents one of the four primary colors: #Hong, red, #Lan, blue, #Huang, yellow, and #Qin, green.

It's particularly common to see the Ruisi used for fortune-telling. Certain stars are associated with each of the Ruisi, and individuals born under each star will often have daily fortunes told for them in the newspapers. This belief is very widespread and is essentially real-world astrology, with very little truth to it.
