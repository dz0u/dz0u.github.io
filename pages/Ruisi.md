- The generally-recognized four gods of the Lu folk religion. Each #god represents one of the four primary colors: #Hong, red, #Lan, blue, #Huang, yellow, and #Qin, green. The Ruisi are the second-most popular religion in Llethis, and the most popular in the #East. However, it is not wise to think of it was organized religion. Faith in the Ruisi is a collection of superstitions and local traditions.
- Each color of the Ruisi, in turn, represent emotions, types of people, etc.. The folk popularity of the Ruisi relies primarily on this convenience of categorization. It's particularly common to see the Ruisi used for fortune-telling. Certain stars are associated with each of the Ruisi, and individuals born under each star will often have daily fortunes told for them in the newspapers. This belief is very widespread and is essentially real-world astrology, with very little truth to it.
- However, the art of #divination is not make-believe in Llethis, and for a true master, even something as simple as the Ruisi can reveal heaven's secrets.
