alias:: moves

- Each time it's their turn, a player gets to make 1 move. There are two types of moves: those against animate things, and those against objects. The only difference is that people have tags, and roll, and objects don't. When you make a move, you roll 3d6. You **cannot** make a move without at least one applicable tag.
	- For example, if you roll against a monster, which is animate, you roll 3d6, adding your #tags and #statuses, and so does the monster.
	- On the other hand, if you roll against a door, which is inanimate, you roll 3d6, adding your tags and statuses, and the door does not roll. The door may have statuses, but it will not have tags (it will be a tag). Another example might be rolling to create a weapon, or find one, or search a room, etc..
- If your roll is greater than your opponent's roll, or the number you needed to succeed, your action succeeds. You then get to make a #action.
- On the other hand, if your roll is less, you fail, and your turn ends. There are no consequences for failing, unless you decide to add one yourself.
- If your roll is equal to the opponent's roll, or the requirement, the next player gets an #opportunity.
- Making a move **ends your turn**.
