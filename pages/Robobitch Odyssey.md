alias:: Sophia,Sophia Gladious

- ### **Backstory**
	- > Sophia's first memories are of the sun shining on the snow. Her parents were merchants, immigrants from Ravenna. Competition in the Nimbus Sea was tough, and so they eventually shifted to leading deliveries of ice to Sameria. For Sophia's safety, she was left with a caretaker at the Ice Mines. Tragically, the ship her parents were on was destroyed in a whirlpool while she was still young. As such, she was essentially raised by a pair of miners on the island. They taught her how to hunt, since they didn't want her to do the same kind of back-breaking labor they did, and meat was always welcome.
	  When she was 18, the Knights Proxy gave a speech at the Ice Mines. At the time, she wasn't exactly inspired. But her dads, both retired Samerian soldiers, encouraged her to join, at least for a short while, not wanting her talent to be wasted. Four years later, she's become a capable squire. But though she's quite young, she can't stay a squire forever, and she's set out to earn her place.
	  
	  *Current Affiliation:* Knights Proxy
	  
	  *Profession:* Bounty Hunter
- ### **Personality**
	- > Very strongly opinionated about the things she cares about, and then careless about everything else, while Sophia's actions may appear ruthless, she follows a strict code of honor that she never betrays. Like many Knights Proxy, what she values is less the idea of punishment, and more the ideal of an organization free of corruption, free of bureaucracy and tired old rules, actions that are consistent, transparent, and driven towards one purpose: the good of all, at the sacrifice of a few bad apples.
	  Part of this ideal involves a strange hero cult surrounding Helewyse. For Sophia, the leader of the Knights Proxy is a true hero to her, someone who not only introduced her to the person who trained her in Vanishing Style, but also even gave her a relic that suited her. She looks up to Helewyse as if she were an older sister, and also as the greatest example of a leader she knows.
- ### **Appearance**
	- > Red hair and equally red eyes distinguish Sophia's appearance. They have the same startling blood-red color. She is fair, almost pale. Though for the most part her clothing and armor hides it, she is quite muscular. Although the Vanishing Style is suitable for all kinds of attacks, she prefers using kicks, for a variety of reasons.

	- ### **<Magics/Fighting Styles/Weapons/Relics>**:
	- Reliquary: The Torch of Artemis Amphipyros. The endlessly-burning flame dedicated to Artemis, preserved in living amber.
		- **Embodiment** [*The Silenced Flame*]: Sophia has physically inherited the talent of Artemis the Huntress in the act of the hunt. Similar to the *Meditation* evolution, but passive (reversed). Unless she's concentrating, she passively generates Focus, disappearing from all senses. When concentrating, a silver flame appears, eventually illuminating to reveal her full presence. When unleashing attacks, her aura and spirit energy give her away.
	- Fighting Styles: Vanishing
		- **Phantom Piercing Technique**: Fully invisible, critical attacks become vorpal.
	- ### Talent: The Golden Bow
	  
	  > Sophia was trained to remember that a good huntress needs to be able to rely on her equipment. To that end, she has learned Enchanting Magic. Her talents are all applications of this subtle power. As a learned magic, it is not considered part of her Awakening, and it has no direct offensive utility. While each talent level is described as "the enchantment on", she is able to apply those enchantments to any item of sufficiently high rank (in terms of material). Each level will describe how long it takes to apply the enchantment.
	- **<Talent Lv. 1>: Artemesia, Unstained**
	  
	  > The powerful enchantment on her amulet absorbs negative magical and alchemical effects, reducing their durations to a few seconds at most. There is no way to purge those effects from the jewel centered in her amulet, so it must be replaced once filled. The enchantment is applied to the amulet itself, and not the jewel. Negative magical and alchemical effects can be thought of as negative status effects, and do not refer to magical damage.
	  The enchantment does not discern between either magical or alchemical effect, instead simply absorbing harmful magical energy below a certain threshold, so to speak. If the enchantment is modified, it is possible to directly absorb almost all harmful magical energy, but the jewel will be used up in just one or two attacks.
	  It takes her a full week of on-and-off labor to apply an enchantment of this level, not to mention material costs of the item and the constant cost of replacing the jewel.
