- To prevent #plunderers from ending the universe itself, Akasha created the #soul, a container for conceptual life force that holds it safely. Thus, #plunderers are no longer a threat to natives of this world, and some have even been accepted among native cultures.
- However, the Loose Change Death is still possible: space-time rifts, #forbidden #magic, and other #god -like beings can still deplete conceptual life force even with the protection of the soul.
