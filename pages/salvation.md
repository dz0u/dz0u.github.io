- The divine rank of Salvation is an interesting one. #Shiyin as a goddess is a very old one. She is a true deity, and clearly one of #Order. Though she has appeared little in the Modern Era, her miracles are well-known, and still occur. Her followers preach forgiveness, mercy, and charity, regardless of how much they practice such things themselves.
- The records of #Akasha state that Shiyin has never once released a divine realm in this or any timeline.
