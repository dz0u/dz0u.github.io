alias:: tags

- Tags come in three types:
	- **Story** tags can be items, places, or other *things* in the story. They're temporary because eventually the characters will move on, or the item will be destroyed or taken away. Story tags can have their own #status es! They can also grant statuses to the person interacting with them. As an easy example, a story tag like **razor trap** might apply a **cut-1** status. Alternatively, a story tag like **flaming dagger** might grant a **burning-weapon-1** status. Another example: an enchanted door might have the status **lasting-4** itself, and apply the status **drained-1** to anyone attempting to open it by force. You can find more important statuses on the #status page.
	- **Ability** tags are exactly what the name implies: unique powers that your character possesses. These can be fairly general: they're meant to describe an aspect of your character's overall moveset. For example, **flying spear technique** could be an ability tag. Or **fire magic**.
	- **Character** tags represent information and background for your character. For example, **nobleman** might be a character tag. This tag could come into play when your character is trying to convince another member of high society, or bribing officials. Likewise, **musician** might work when rolling to perform a piece for funds. Alternatively, a character tag like **intimidating appearance** might work when interrogating an enemy, or it could have a negative effect when trying to make a friend.
