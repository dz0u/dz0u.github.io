- # Organization of the Wiki
	- This wiki was written using [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) and published using this [tool](https://github.com/logseq/publish-spa).
	- You can find most important pages under **Favorites** to the left.
	- Links can be followed simply by clicking on them, but hovering over a link will show a preview!
	- The goal of this central page is that you are able to understand the lore and mechanics of RP in the server simply by reading this page from top to bottom.
	- You can hide any headered block by hovering over its heading and clicking the little triangle that appears (shows up on the right on mobile, no need to hover). This might make it easier to navigate this page.
- # Lore
	- ## Teachings
	- ``Lore in this section is presented as the writings of prominent NPCs you might meet through RP. They are publicly available records that can be found in collections and libraries worldwide, and are translated into many languages. Note that although they are publicly available, most people would likely be unable to access them due to the difficulty of travel, lack of interest, and general lack of awareness. The more esoteric knowledge here is not common knowledge.``
	- ### *Journals of the Immortal Witch*
		- Magecraft is older than written history, making it difficult to pin down where it first emerged. What we know is that magic is connected to spoken words, regardless of what language is used. All mortal magic comes from the Dreamer, who bound her limitless power to the very concept of speech. For this reason, we mages offer thanks to this great and terrible Goddess.
		- Most people are capable of minor exertions of magic. However, those with the talent to become true mages are rare, and only about one in a hundred have an adequate amount of mental strength. This difference usually shows itself in early childhood.
		- For those with the talent to use magic, the first lesson must be the basics of how magic works. There are three steps to magic. Firstly, one visualizes the effect they wish to achieve. Secondly, the mage speaks the incantation they devised to activate it, maintaining their vision clearly in their mind. Finally, the spell is activated.
		- Complex magics are harder to visualize, and result in greater mental fatigue. Research has shown that when spells are cast, a vast amount of calculation is conducted by the brain to "fill in" the gaps in imagination. However, only the subconscious, language-faculty part of the brain is responsible for this. While repeated use will strengthen this part of the brain, the best way to improve your magic and relieve strain is to move some of that subconscious calculation into conscious thought.
		- This comes with better understanding of your magic. In other words, the clearer your visualization, the less work your brain needs to do to fill in the gaps, and the more magic you can use without becoming fatigued.
		- Human knowledge is, however, limited. For this reason, many mages pursue simple magics like the elemental powers, which are easy to understand and familiarize oneself with. Some mages have tinkered with modifying their body and brains to strengthen them, while others devise complex magic circles that undertake some of the computational burden automatically.
		- Though some of these strategies are successful, the limitations of time and lifespan mean that most mages can only pursue a few tracks of magic in a lifetime.

	- ### *A Historical Analysis of Thaumaturgy*
		- Thaumaturgy, or divine magic, refers to the various powers granted by one of the living divinities to their faithful. Its existence is objective fact. There are three divinities usually found among thaumaturges: priests of Shiyin, the cultists of Maka, and the fairy knights of Atenfowi.
		- Excluding Shiyin's priests, thaumaturges are super rare. You can always tell a thaumaturge because they don't need to speak an incantation for their magic. Thaumaturges usually have had a close encounter with the divinity they worship.
		- The power of a thaumaturge depends on the faith they have in their divinity. Using thaumaturgy requires you to clear your mind and give yourself to your deity wholeheartedly. Only then can they exert their power through you. In exchange, the mental burden of using divine magic is negated. For this reason, thaumaturges are often sought as powerful mages.
		- Thaumaturges practice rituals, prayer, and worship to deepen their devotion to their deity, making it easier to connect. However, most deities do not allow their disciples to worship or connect to any other deity. They are usually able to use regular magic, though they might find it less rewarding.
		- Shiyin's priests have a slightly different experience. Almost anyone who worships the benevolent goddess may borrow her powers. The only requirement is true faith. The deeper the faith, the more good actions, and the further the priest spreads the faith, the more powerful their thaumaturgy.

	- ### *A Mechanic's Toolbook, 2nd Edition*
		- You currently hold in your hands the second edition of *A Mechanic's Toolbook*. When I read the first edition, I was but a young lad working on Mr. J. Earp's copper mine. Mr. Earp had ordered a brand new engine from Mr. S. Ramathusan, so as to draw water out of an old, flooded tunnel. The foreman couldn't understand head or tails of it, so he gathered those of us that could read, and we went over the whole toolbook page by page, as if it were a holy grail.
		- Now I am Director of the International Board of Steam Mechanics, and it is my honor to write the preface to this guide for a new generation of mechanics. The machines you will be working on are no longer the simple pumps and engines of my youth. If you're reading this in Alaris or Naleania, you have most likely heard of the new Transcontinental Railway, which may be open by the time you read this. Airships powered by new magical engines now float in the skies, and steam power is replacing sails in the waters.
		- Every part of our world is changing thanks to this revolutionary new technology. It's possible that wars will be a thing of the past, and soldiers will hang up their guns after visiting the lands of their former enemies, thanks to the new rails! And you will be a part of that transformation!

		- There are six great nations ruling the inhabitable lands of the world. A traveler would do wise to understand that the laws in any one country are largely decided by provincial ordinances, and to be cautious at all times.
		- Nonetheless, we will attempt to provide an excellent summary for the new traveler of the various nations peculiarities, so that they may experience a safe and enjoyable journey.
			- The Principality of Alaris is the home of the Astellian people, who you may know for their peculiar round ears (much like a Lu's) and lack of physical adornment. They are a strict people. Denathan travelers in particular, be observant! There is a saying: when in Movil, do as the Movilans do. Alaris's laws are harsh, due to its archaic, feudal system. It is a very old country, and you may find interesting the relics and historical sites of the country, as well as the fabulous art galleries and operas.
			- The Naleanian Commonwealth, spread around the Inner Sea, is where most Denathan folk live. A Denathan may be recognized for his or her
